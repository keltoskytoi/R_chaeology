# R_chaeology

This repository will (finally) contain all kinds of data, thoughts and information about this project. I am not coming from a programming background, so my code will seem to a lot of you plain and simple. My first and main goal is to create code which works -  estetics comes later - probably in a form of an R-package - LATER... :) Feel free to comment in the name of open-source and open-access data and ideas!
